# ATM Simulation System (C++)

This project simulates a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) using C++. It allows users to log in with a secure PIN and perform core banking operations such as checking balance, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and exiting the session. The program is menu-driven and built using object-oriented principles.

---

## Overview

The application uses class-based design to simulate a bank account system. It includes user authentication and a looped transaction flow to support multiple actions in one session. The primary focus is to practice class inheritance, method encapsulation, and user input handling in C++.

---

## Features

- PIN-based login system
- Balance check functionality
- Deposit operation to increase account balance
- Withdrawal operation to decrease account balance
- Session continues until the user decides to exit
- Use of class inheritance (`class A : public B`)
- Operator overloading for displaying balance
- Encapsulation of account details

---

## Program Flow

1. Prompt for a 4-digit PIN
2. Authenticate against the hardcoded PIN (`8302`)
3. If successful, display a menu:
   - Check Balance
   - Deposit
   - Withdraw
   - Exit
4. After each action, prompt the user to continue or end the session
5. Maintain and update the balance throughout

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Object-Oriented Programming in C++
- Class inheritance and method overriding
- Operator overloading (`<<`)
- User input and conditional logic
- Looping and menu-driven interaction
